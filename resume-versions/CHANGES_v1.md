## Summary of Changes

Updated resume to highlight observability, event-driven architecture, and Datadog APM experience relevant to Datadog's platform.

## New Bullets Added (2U Section)

### 1. AWS SNS/SQS Monitoring Infrastructure (NEW - First bullet)

**Why this works for Datadog:**
- Shows observability focus (monitoring infrastructure)
- Demonstrates event-driven architecture experience
- Highlights debugging and data management skills
- Mentions scale (15+ programs)

### 2. Datadog APM Integration (NEW - Second bullet)

**Why this works for Datadog:**
- **Direct Datadog product experience** (APM!)
- Demonstrates distributed tracing expertise
- Shows end-to-end observability mindset
- Highlights troubleshooting and visibility improvements

2. Performance optimization (React)
3. Draft/publishing workflow
4. CI/CD optimization
5. Data pipelines (Kafka-like streaming)
6. Cross-functional initiatives

**New Order (Datadog-focused):**
1. **SNS/SQS monitoring infrastructure** (NEW - observability focus)
2. **Datadog APM integration** (NEW - their product!)
3. Data migration (Elasticsearch) - still relevant for search/indexing at scale
4. Data pipelines (Kafka-like streaming) - event-driven architecture
5. Performance optimization (React) - scalability
6. CI/CD optimization - DevOps/automation
7. Draft/publishing workflow - still strong but lower priority for Datadog
8. Cross-functional initiatives - leadership/collaboration

## Keywords Added for ATS

- AWS SNS/SQS
- Datadog APM
- Distributed tracing
- Event processing pipeline
- Topic-based routing
- Dead-letter queue
- Message flow visibility
- Observability

## Original Bullets Retained

All original strong bullets kept, just reordered for relevance:
- ✅ Data migration with billions of events (scale)
- ✅ Elasticsearch integration (search/observability)
- ✅ Performance metrics (33%, 50% improvements)
- ✅ Kafka-like streaming (1M+ daily events)
