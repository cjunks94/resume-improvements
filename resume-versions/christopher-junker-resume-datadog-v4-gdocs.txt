PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

2U, Brooklyn, NY
Senior Software Engineer (Promoted August 2022 – Present)
Software Engineer (August 2018 – July 2022)

• Built production AWS SQS monitoring tool in Go with WebSocket real-time updates, serving 15+ university programs for queue operations, dead-letter queue debugging, and message retry capabilities; deployed as single binary with embedded frontend assets and 230+ tests (80%+ coverage).

• Developed Salesforce data validation service in Go (Gin framework) with React/TypeScript frontend, deployed in Kubernetes sharing ATM sidecar for secret management; provides REST API for comparing AMT records against Salesforce to debug sync discrepancies across production environments.

• Served as primary on-call engineer and team lead for production AMT platform (10,000+ users), responding to critical incidents including API outages and payment integration failures; monitored SLOs/SLAs, wrote post-mortems, and advised on service reliability definitions across microservices ecosystem.

• Built comprehensive Datadog observability infrastructure including custom dashboards, alerts (Redis memory >90%, API performance), and deployment scorecards with unified service tagging (environment, service, version); implemented distributed tracing across multi-system architecture (AMT → SNS/SQS → Sidekiq → external APIs) with custom metrics for endpoint QPR, response time, and compute load.

• Developed and maintained Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment managing multiple services (web, job queue, Passport consumer, secrets sidecar) with rolling update strategies, horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU/memory thresholds, liveness/readiness probes, and resource limits for high-availability production environments.

• Implemented AWS SNS/SQS monitoring infrastructure alongside existing WebSocket integration for Salesforce data synchronization, enabling topic-based routing, dead-letter queue tracking, and improved debugging capabilities for data influx management across 15+ university programs.

• Architected distributed Redis caching layer shared across Rails monolith and microservices ecosystem, implementing write-through cache pattern (Rails writes, services read with API fallback on miss) and separate namespaces for application cache vs. Sidekiq job queue, optimizing cross-service performance.

• Implemented production resilience patterns including circuit breakers for external system integrations enabling immediate business action during outages, and Sidekiq/Celery retry logic with exponential backoff for data synchronization jobs across 15+ university programs.

• Implemented comprehensive audit trail using PaperTrail gem across 10+ models with automated whodunnit tracking in all controllers, enabling full versioning history and compliance auditing for user actions and data modifications.

• Architected multi-year data migration from legacy Python/MongoDB to Rails/MySQL, ingesting billions of events with zero downtime; integrated Elasticsearch for real-time search/indexing, enabling 50% faster admin queries and supporting scalable observability for user analytics.

• Built and maintained data pipelines using StreamSets/AWS for ETL on sensitive user data; integrated Kafka-like streaming for real-time anomaly detection, processing 1M+ daily events and aligning with distributed systems principles for cloud migration scalability.

• Led performance optimization of React frontend handling high-traffic forms (10K+ concurrent users), implementing async data loading and caching; reduced initial page loads from 3s to 2s (33% improvement), minimizing outliers during peak loads via AWS Lambda edge computing.

• Optimized CI/CD pipelines with parallel testing in Kubernetes, halving suite runtime from 45min to 22min; mentored 5 junior engineers on Docker and Kubernetes best practices, boosting team velocity by 25% and reducing production incidents through automated monitoring alerts.

• Implemented secure AWS Secrets Manager integration with Kubernetes persistent volumes and dedicated ATM (AWS Token Manager) sidecar for automatic credential rotation, managing database passwords, API tokens, and third-party service credentials across multiple environments.

• Directed cross-functional initiatives, including shell-scripted MongoDB access for compliance audits; fostered team cohesion through weekly tech talks on emerging tools (e.g., Go for microservices), resulting in 2 adopted prototypes for internal tools.
