**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025, 2:00 PM EDT
**Application Deadline**: October 27, 2025

---

## High Priority (Complete by October 23, 2025)

### [ ] Tailor Resume for Datadog Posting
- **Why**: ATS alignment and keyword optimization (e.g., "observability," "distributed systems") increase callback rates
- **Similar**: Use terms like "real-time analytics" or "cloud-native scalability" interchangeably
- **Action**: Revise summary and bullets to match Datadog job description; run through ATS checker (e.g., Resume Worded)
- **Target**: October 21, 2025
- **Final Deadline**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours

### [ ] Publish a Technical Blog or X Post on Observability
- **Why**: Thought leadership enhances your profile; Datadog engineers engage on such platforms
- **Similar**: Cover topics like Elasticsearch tuning or Prometheus metrics as alternatives
- **Action**: Adapt an internal wiki article (e.g., Elasticsearch optimization) into a Medium post or X thread; tag Datadog engineers
- **Target**: October 22, 2025
- **Update Resume**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours

### [ ] Network with Datadog Engineers
- **Why**: Direct connections improve application odds in competitive hiring pools
- **Similar**: Engage with engineers at other observability firms (e.g., New Relic) for broader reach
- **Action**: Identify 3-5 Datadog engineers on LinkedIn/X; comment on posts or send intro messages
- **Target**: October 23, 2025
- **Follow Up**: November 1, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

### [ ] Mentor Juniors on Kubernetes Best Practices
- **Why**: Mentoring and K8s expertise align with Datadog's team-scaling needs
- **Similar**: Include Docker Swarm or OpenShift as related container orchestration skills
- **Action**: Document mentoring impact (e.g., faster service rollouts); schedule a K8s best practices session
- **Target**: October 22, 2025
- **Update Resume**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (documentation + session prep)

## Medium Priority (Complete by October 26, 2025)

### [ ] Implement a Kafka-Style Event Streaming Solution
- **Why**: Event-driven architectures are key for Datadog's real-time monitoring and trillion-event scale
- **Similar**: Use RabbitMQ or Apache Pulsar as an alternative to Kafka for event streaming
- **Action**: Document existing pipeline work in resume; add a mini-project (e.g., RabbitMQ producer/consumer in Python) to GitHub
- **Target**: October 24, 2025
- **Update Resume**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 6-8 hours
- **Deliverables**:
  - GitHub repo with working producer/consumer
  - Docker Compose setup
  - README with architecture explanation
  - Basic performance metrics (events/sec)

### [ ] Develop a Go-Based Microservice Project
- **Why**: Datadog uses Go for its backend and distributed systems; a project shows adaptability
- **Similar**: Use a lightweight alternative like Rust for microservices if Go is new (optional pivot)
- **Action**: Build a small repo (e.g., "GoLogStream" or "RustEventProc") for log aggregation (100K events/day target); add README
- **Target**: October 25, 2025
- **Update Resume**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 8-10 hours
- **Deliverables**:
  - Go microservice with REST API
  - Log ingestion and basic aggregation
  - Unit tests (>70% coverage)
  - Docker containerization
  - Performance benchmarks

### [ ] Prototype an AI/ML-Enhanced Feature
- **Why**: AI-driven ops (e.g., Watchdog) are a Datadog strength; a prototype shows forward-thinking
- **Similar**: Use TensorFlow or scikit-learn as alternatives to PyTorch for anomaly detection
- **Action**: Build a basic anomaly detection tool (e.g., flagging data inconsistencies); share on GitHub with demo
- **Target**: October 26, 2025
- **Update Resume**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 6-8 hours
- **Deliverables**:
  - Python script using scikit-learn
  - Jupyter notebook with visualization
  - Sample dataset and results
  - README explaining approach

### [ ] Lead a Cross-Team Observability Initiative
- **Why**: Driving system-wide visibility is a senior-level expectation at Datadog
- **Similar**: Leverage existing AWS CloudWatch experience; explore New Relic or Prometheus as complementary tools
- **Action**: Add a bullet on leading a monitoring effort (e.g., CloudWatch setup reducing incidents); propose an internal demo
- **Target**: October 23, 2025
- **Update Resume**: October 27, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (documentation + demo prep)

## Low Priority (Complete by November 3, 2025)

### [ ] Contribute to Open-Source or Earn a Certification
- **Why**: Public contributions or certs boost visibility in tech circles like Datadog's
- **Similar**: Target CNCF (e.g., Kubernetes CKAD) or AWS DevOps certification
- **Action**: Pin an existing Rails plugin or start a new contribution (e.g., async monitoring tool); register for a free cert course
- **Target**: October 23, 2025 (registration)
- **Update Resume**: November 3, 2025
- **Time Estimate**: Ongoing (10-20 hours for certification study)
- **Options**:
  - CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)
  - AWS Certified DevOps Engineer
  - Open-source contribution to observability tool (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
