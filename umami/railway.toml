# Railway.app Configuration - Umami Analytics
# Configuration as Code for Railway deployment
# Author: Chris Junker – Senior Engineer

# NOTE: This file is currently for DOCUMENTATION ONLY.
# Railway does not automatically read this file - you must configure
# environment variables manually in the Railway dashboard.
# This file serves as a reference for required configuration.

[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
# No custom startCommand needed - handled by docker-entrypoint.sh
# The entrypoint script automatically runs migrations before starting the server
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

# Health check endpoint
healthcheckPath = "/api/heartbeat"
healthcheckTimeout = 10

[deploy.env]
# Required environment variables (set these in Railway dashboard):
# - DATABASE_URL (automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL service)
# - DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql
# - HASH_SALT (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
# - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
# - POSTGRES_PASSWORD (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
# - CLIENT_IP_HEADER=CF-Connecting-IP (for Cloudflare proxy)
# - DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
# - NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
# - NODE_ENV=production
# - PORT=3000

# Optional - Automatic Password Reset:
# - UMAMI_ADMIN_PASSWORD (your desired admin password)
#   If set, admin password will be automatically reset on every deployment
#   If not set, default password remains "umami" (login: admin/umami)

# CORS Configuration (Required for cross-origin tracking):
# - CORS=* (allow all origins - simplest)
# OR
# - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://cjunker.dev,https://staging.cjunker.dev
#   Comma-separated list of allowed origins for API requests
#   Required to track pageviews from your domains (prevents CORS errors)

# Auto-Migration Behavior:
# - Prisma migrations run automatically on every deployment via docker-entrypoint.sh
# - Migrations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
# - If migration fails, container will not start (fail-safe)
# - Migration logs visible in Railway deployment logs
